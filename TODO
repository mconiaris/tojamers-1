ROUTES TO FIX IF SESSION == NULL

/stories/:story_id/pitches - shows all pitches (not just the users) even though there is no login. Right now it does not behave as we want.

/stories - needs if statment for null session. Right now it crashes.

/stories/new - needs if statement for null session. Right now it crashes.

/stories/:id/edit - needs if statement for null session. Right now it crashes.

/stories/:id - needs if statement for null session. Right now it crashes.

/admin/users - loads even in a null session, which is not the desired behavior. Probably needs an if statment to ensure that if a user is not an admin that it redirects.

/pitches/individual - crashes when session is null.

/pitches/business - crashes when session is null.
